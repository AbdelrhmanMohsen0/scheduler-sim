# Priority Scheduling Simulator (Non-Preemptive)
A simulation tool for non-preemptive priority scheduling algorithms, designed to model and analyze how tasks are executed based on fixed priority levels.

## Features:
- Simulates non-preemptive scheduling behavior for various priority-based task execution scenarios.
- Generates a Gantt Chart to Visualize the execution order of tasks based on their assigned priority.
- Allows customization of process burst time, arrival time, and priority level.
- Generates performance metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and response time.

## Usage:
- Define processes with priority levels and execution durations.
- Generate a Gantt Chart for the defined processes.
- View results in graphical format for better insights.
- Perfect for students, educators, and professionals looking to understand and experiment with priority-based scheduling algorithms!
